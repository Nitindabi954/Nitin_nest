# The `Node` API takes the name of the node as a string,
# and the same name is used to return results.
h1 = Node("h1")

# Connect the above two hosts using a veth (virtual Ethernet)
# pair and return the interfaces at the end points of the link
# as a tuple `eth1` and `eth2`. `eth1` interface is at `h1` and
# `eth2` interface is at `h2`.
# The `connect` API takes two hosts as the parameters and returns
# the pair of interfaces.

# Set the link attributes such as bandwidth and propagation delay.
# The attributes for the link from `h1` to `h2` are set at
# interface `eth1` (and vice versa).
# Note that the bandwidth and propagation delay can be asymmetric.
# In the real deployments, upload and download bandwidth is not
# the same, and even propagation delays can vary because the
# forward and reverse paths can be different.

# `Ping` from `h1` to `h2`.
